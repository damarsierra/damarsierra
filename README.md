### Hola! Welcome to my junk draw- I mean ✨projects✨!
Right now I'm working towards getting all *stacked* in DevOps Engineering 👀
So far, I've been working on my GitHub skills (actions, you're next...) and on my Azure knowledge! (I've already been messing with pipelines on there 😶‍🌫️)

Hopefully I keep this here space of mine updated with new, cool things!
